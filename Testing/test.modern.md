# Tests

There are many complexities in life. But there are some beauties in it too, such as the reaction of Carbon Dioxide ($Co_2$):

$$
Ca(Co)_2(ag)\rightarrow{Ca(ag)_2(Co)_3}
$$

There's also some beauties, in the **formating**, _syntax_, and ~~energy~~ we put into actions. The numbers or equations we draw:

$$
\sum_{n=2}^{1024}2n \Rightarrow 1024
$$

There's also something about the

## Size

### Gradual increment

#### And scale of things

Font's and others are a baffling conundrum. Tables:

| X   | Y     |
| --- | ----- |
| $1$ | $2$   |
| $6$ | $-2$  |
| $0$ | $x^2$ |

## For decades

We've pondered the art, and _imagery_ of the world around us — Only trying to capture its grasp within what we call _art_:

![Figure 1: A great example of my friend's Nvidia experience](image.png)

Footers, sources, and links are also great ways of knowing all about the world around us.[^1]

When one's art, the formatting of things comes all into importance. For instance, ponder, and yonder at the duplicates at the test, all written in `modern.md`, `formal.mla.md` and `modernly-formal.smart.md`

It is also when one realizes that the GitHub actions behind these modernized writing styles verify grammar and MLA style. Automatically, without even a press of a button.

Oh, but code:

```json
{
  "some-example": "code"
}
```

— and it's `words` is also an important part of our modern decade. Where would we stand today if not for the modern Picasso, the programmers with their rainbow words stood and articulated everything we had. A sort of.. [link](#for-decades) between the old and the modern.

When all is at hopes, remember that you can:

- [ ] Cross
- [x] List
- Dot
  - And hope.

1. Numerically,
2. too.

### Where eyes fall flat

Is on the accursed formatting of this document, mixed and matched dots and lines, unordered contents of headers, oh is it oh so cruel. HTML renditions of &OpenCurlyDoubleQuote;characters&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote; are entirely abysmal to inline.

If only this document served as a _reference_ as to where good characters lie:

|                  Symbol | HTML                      |
| ----------------------: | :------------------------ |
|  &OpenCurlyDoubleQuote; | `&OpenCurlyDoubleQuote;`  |
| &CloseCurlyDoubleQuote; | `&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote;` |

Sadly that's where things lie, in the lands where equations are jargons of characters:

$$
\frac{2x\times{y}}{x-2^y}
$$

```tex
$$
\frac{2x\times{y}}{x-2^y}
$$
```

## The length

Of this document is extremely long, would you believe it is truly just a _test_ document? It is true that what those might not believe, is that testing is actually very extensive — and so is thy Markdown spec.

It is near unimaginable.

And all of that for things like ~small~ ~text~, high up ^text^, and more stupidity.

Did you hear? Oxygen is rendered as O~2~, the power of small numbers, when compared to the inferior O2, or O&#8322; (with a unicode character, which doesn't even have a html name!).

There's a lot unappreciated in text, such as the page break you see above. Fractions with inline math $$

Here's a Pythagorean theorm:

$$
pyth(a,b)=
\begin{cases}
a^2+b^2=c^2 \\
a>0 \\
b>0
\end{cases}
$$

> Indentation is also important, y'know?

> > So important you may have to do it twice.

Vectors!
