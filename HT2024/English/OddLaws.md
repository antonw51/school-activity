In Youngstown, _it's illegal_ to _run out of gas_.

It was a late night, somewhere around late march. Tyler was _late_ for his niece's birthday party, and he hadn't even head off to make the long drive.

As he woke up, realizing he had overslept, he quickly got prepared and headed out to his car. It was an older car, though still Tyler's favorite. He stepped in, turned the ignition, and headed off.

Around after a minute or two, he noticed the gauge on the dash showed the fuel level as basically empty; "No biggie", Tyler told himself like he had many times before. He had amassed through experience that his car basically ran on fumes for really long, he'd just get to the party, and tank up on the way home.

About 3 miles in, the bright _low fuel indicator light_ began to blink, with a soft beep to follow; coincidentally so, just as Tyler had passed a perfectly good gas station, a grave error it'd turn out as he turned in towards the highway. "No biggie" was the recurring phrase here.

20 miles in, the engine had began making some real strange noises, and the veichle seemed to run out of kicks.
