# Eventline

On october 23th 3:44pm, the victim was strangled to death in her room by hands of the hotel cleaner who had been working that day, she had _"personal"_ history with the vitcim.

- A power outage was caused by the cleaner right after at 3:47pm, and was used as an alibi by the cleaner.
- A master key had been stolen a few days prior to the actual crime, and hasn't been found since.
- The body was discovered relatively late by the victim's late working husband. Due to being a day late and the AC in the room being extremely cold, it was impossible to estimate a time of death.
- A day prior, to the crime, the tenant next door had called in about loud noises from the couples hotel room, sounding something like a verbal conflict.
  - The husband was part of this argument, but the couples relationship was healthy nontheless.
- The cleaner, having heard this commotion herself, turned the hotel room upside down to make it seem like a physical struggle had occured. She does not mention the noise.
