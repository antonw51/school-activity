# Eventline

On october 23th 3:44pm, the victim was strangled to death in her room by hands of the hotel cleaner who had been working that day, she had _"personal"_ history with the vitcim.

- A power outage was caused by the cleaner right after at 3:47pm, and was used as an alibi by the cleaner.
- A master key had been stolen a few days prior to the actual crime, and hasn't been found since.
- The body was discovered relatively late by the victim's late working husband. Due to being a day late and the AC in the room being extremely cold, it was impossible to estimate a time of death.
- A day prior, to the crime, the tenant next door had called in about loud noises from the couples hotel room, sounding something like a verbal conflict.
  - The husband was part of this argument, but the couples relationship was healthy nontheless.
- The cleaner, having heard this commotion herself, turned the hotel room upside down to make it seem like a physical struggle had occured. She does not mention the noise.

> Plant some kind of cleaning material in the apartment? How does one make that not obvious? Seems easier than creating a tangled web of evidence and alibis.

## Actual eventline

(Victim has been at her room all-day, the cleaner has already long-ago stolen the master key)

Setting: A "luxury" hotel, that looks all fancy, but is severely understaffed due to budget-cuts, and lessening customers.

- A few days prior...
  - The cleaner steals the _master key_.
  - A next-door neighbor (with verified allibi) calls in a noise complaint of the husband and victim arguing.
- Tuesday ("The day prior")
  - The receptionist takes a day off, calling it in, and leaving front-office empty for a moment.
  - The cleaner goes and performs the murder â€” strangling the victim.
  - Uses the cleaning job to create time to hide the evidence.
  - The cleaner causes a power outage, which temporarily delays the AC, hiding the time of death of the victim; and creating herself an alibi. "Doing the laundary".
- Wednesday ("Discovery")
  - The victim's husband discovers the body on the room floor.
  - Detective arrives on scene, instigators deem the body's time of death unidentifiable due to the "faulty" AC.
  - The husband is found next to the victim.

Detective name: Adam.
